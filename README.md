# Salesforce-Bulk-Api

## Overview

Salesforce bulk Api is a simple ruby gem for connecting to and using the Salesforce Bulk API. It is actually a re-written code from [salesforce_bulk](https://github.com/jorgevaldivia/salesforce_bulk).Written to suit many more other features as well.

## How to use

Using this gem is simple and straight forward.

To initialize:

   `sudo gem install salesforce_bulk_api`

or add

   `gem salesforce_bulk_api`
   
in your Gemfile

There are two ways to authenticate with SalesForce to use the Bulk API: databasedotcom & restforce.
Please check out the entire documentation of the gem you decide to use to learn the various ways of authentication.

[Databasedotcom](https://github.com/heroku/databasedotcom)
[Restforce](https://github.com/ejholmes/restforce)


You can use username password combo, OmniAuth, Oauth2
You can as many records possible in the Array. Governor limits are taken care of inside the gem.




	require 'salesforce_bulk_api'
	client = Databasedotcom::Client.new :client_id =>  $SFDC_APP_CONFIG["client_id"], :client_secret => $SFDC_APP_CONFIG["client_secret"] #client_id and client_secret respectively
	client.authenticate :token => "my-oauth-token", :instance_url => "http://na1.salesforce.com"  #=> "my-oauth-token"
	salesforce = SalesforceBulkApi::Api.new(client)

OR

	require 'salesforce_bulk_api'
	client = Restforce.new(
	  username:       SFDC_APP_CONFIG['SFDC_USERNAME'],
	  password:       SFDC_APP_CONFIG['SFDC_PASSWORD'],
	  security_token: SFDC_APP_CONFIG['SFDC_SECURITY_TOKEN'],
	  client_id:      SFDC_APP_CONFIG['SFDC_CLIENT_ID'],
	  client_secret:  SFDC_APP_CONFIG['SFDC_CLIENT_SECRET'].to_i,
	  host:           SFDC_APP_CONFIG['SFDC_HOST']
	)

	salesforce = SalesforceBulkApi::Api.new(client)


Sample operations:
    # Insert/Create
    # Add as many fields per record as needed.
	new_account = Hash["name" => "Test Account", "type" => "Other"] 
	records_to_insert = Array.new
	# You can add as many records as you want here, just keep in mind that Salesforce has governor limits.
	records_to_insert.push(new_account) 
	result = salesforce.create("Account", records_to_insert)
	puts "result is: #{result.inspect}"

    # Update
	updated_account = Hash["name" => "Test Account -- Updated", id => "a00A0001009zA2m"] # Nearly identical to an insert, but we need to pass the salesforce id.
	records_to_update = Array.new
	records_to_update.push(updated_account)
	salesforce.update("Account", records_to_update)

    # Upsert
	upserted_account = Hash["name" => "Test Account -- Upserted", "External_Field_Name" => "123456"] # Fields to be updated. External field must be included
	records_to_upsert = Array.new
	records_to_upsert.push(upserted_account)
	salesforce.upsert("Account", records_to_upsert, "External_Field_Name") # Note that upsert accepts an extra parameter for the external field name

    # Delete
	deleted_account = Hash["id" => "a00A0001009zA2m"] # We only specify the id of the records to delete
	records_to_delete = Array.new
	records_to_delete.push(deleted_account)
	salesforce.delete("Account", records_to_delete)

    # Query
	res = salesforce.query("Account", "select id, name, createddate from Account limit 3") # We just need to pass the sobject name and the query string

## Installation
    sudo gem install salesforce_bulk_api
